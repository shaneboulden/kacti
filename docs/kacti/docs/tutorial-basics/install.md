# Install

`kacti` provides binary releases that you can install to your local system.

All binaries are released via the `kacti` [Github page](https://github.com/shaneboulden/kacti):
```bash
$ curl -Lo kacti https://github.com/shaneboulden/kacti/releases/latest/download/kacti-linux-amd64 && \
      sudo mv kacti /usr/local/bin/kacti && \
      sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/kacti
```
That's it! `kacti` is installed and ready to go.
